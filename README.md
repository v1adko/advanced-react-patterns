## Advanced React Patterns

Definitely check out [Egghead.io](https://egghead.io/courses/advanced-react-component-patterns) course by [Kent C. Dodds](https://twitter.com/kentcdodds)  
This is the result of me following along his explanations (and peeking at the original repo to fill the code gaps between the lessons).  

I've used [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) to enable hot-reloading and do it a bit differently (more traditionally) to single-file approach.
